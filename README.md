## Editing the Portfolio

To customize your portfolio, navigate to the `src/components` directory. You can edit various components to update the content, styles, and layout of your portfolio as needed.

### Customizing the Contact Us Screen
1. **Open the Contact Us Component:**
   Locate the `Contact.jsx` file in the `src/components` directory.

2. **Replace the FormCarry URL:**
   In the `handleSubmit` function, update the URL in the `fetch` call to point to your desired form handling service. For example:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://your-custom-url.com/api/contact',
    ```
